CPUFeature
==========

CPUFeature is a tool for detecting CPU features on x86/AMD64 processors. In particular it is engineered to have very low overhead on import (~ 1 ms) and to detect features that are often important in high-performance computing where hybrid combinations of multi-threading and multi-processing are used. Detects CPU features such as:

* SIMD instruction support
* Number of cores (both virtual and physical)
* Number of CPUs on the motherboard.
* Cache sizes

It is written in C99. It supports Windows with MSVC and Linux with GCC/LLVM compilers. MacOSX should also work with GCC/LLVM. CPUFeature is licensed under Creative Commons Zero, so it may be freely incorporated as a submodule into your own projects.

CPUFeature is considered to be in an alpha state because while it is tested via GitHub Actions on a variety of platforms, we expect edge cases to appear.

Example
-------

The module generates a `dict` called `CPUFeature` on import which contains useful information regarding optimization and compilation for the host. For my Intel i7-7820X Skylake CPU, it generates the following info:

```
    > python -c "import cpufeature; cpufeature.print_features()"

Notes on Fields
---------------

* If `num_threads_per_core > 1` likely Intel Hyperthreading (or equivalent architecture) is present. The physical core count may be unreliable in virtual environments.
* Cache sizes are in bytes.
* For AVX2, check `AVX2` and `OS_AVX2`.
* For AVX512, check `AVX512f` and `OS_AVX512`. Python support for AVX512 instructions is highly limited outside of compilation with ICC. MSVC does not have AVX512 support until MSVC2017.

* Ported to Python by Robert A. McLeod, who added detection of cores, and cache sizes.
* `drfinkus` contributed to AMD support.
* `WidgetA` contributed support for compilation with Clang.
