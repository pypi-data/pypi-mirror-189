=========
formparse
=========


    Simple library for evaluating mathematical formulas.


Written as an safe alternative to Pythons ``eval()`` function the aim was to provide a lightweight library that could
evaluate mathematical formulas provided by users in a safe way.

Alternatives
============

``numexpr``:
------------

``numexpr`` is a Python library for ``numpy`` that accelerates array operations
but it can hadnle simple string calculations as well. It is therefore a lot bigger than
``formparse`` but if you are using ``numpy`` anyways in you project or need additional
features that we do not provide this might be a good fit. Check out its repo 
`here <https://github.com/pydata/numexpr>`_ .
