    This is a simple tool for converting MP3 audio files to text. It makes use of the SpeechRecognition, pydub, colorlog and argparse packages. The tool first converts the MP3 file to a WAV file and then uses the SpeechRecognition package to perform the speech-to-text conversion.
    
    To use the module you need to have a mp3 directory with .mp3 file/-s in it wherever you want to use the module.
    
    The source code is available on GitLab at https://gitlab.com/python3-projects/speechrecognition/mp3totext.
