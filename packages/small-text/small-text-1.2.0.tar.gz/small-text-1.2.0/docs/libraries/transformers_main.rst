Transformers Integration
========================

The Transformers Integration makes :ref:`transformer-based classification <libraries/transformers_main:Transformer-based Classification>` and
:ref:`sentence transformer finetuning <libraries/transformers_main:Sentence Transformer Finetuning>` usable in small-text.
It relies on the :doc:`Pytorch Integration<pytorch_main>` which is therefore a prerequisite.

.. note:: Some implementation make use of :ref:`optional dependencies <install:Optional Dependencies>`.
