# dash-ag-grid

Thank you for your interest in Dash AG Grid open source!
The 1.x series of this package is commercially distributed on
instances of Dash Enterprise https://plotly.com/dash/.

We haven't yet released the final v2.0.0 open-source version.

To install an alpha release, you need to specify the version
exactly, for example `pip install dash-ag-grid==2.0.0a1`
See https://pypi.org/project/dash-ag-grid/#history
for the list of available versions.

!! Be aware there will likely be breaking changes before the
final v2.0.0 open-source release.

If you are a Dash Enterprise customer and you want to continue
using the v1.x series, please ensure you've installed dash-ag-grid
with the `--extra-index-url` argument, either in your requirements.txt
file or in the command line, so that the package is installed from
Dash Enterprise's private, commercial package repository instead of from
pypi.org. Visit the docs for your Dash Enterprise installation at:
https://<your-dash-enterprise-instance>/Docs
for details.
