# duper

20-50x faster than `copy.deepcopy()` on mutable objects

Aims to fill the gaps in performance and obscurity between copy, pickle, json and other serialization libraries, becoming the go-to library for copying objects within the same Python process.

![timesup_duper_demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36469655/215218569-1f833d77-d974-49ab-98cf-a03d9ab32899.gif)


### ðŸš§ Project is in development
Current priorities
- [x] Support for immutable types
- [x] Support for builtin types
- [x] Support for arbitrary types
- [x] Partial support for `__deepcopy__` and `__copy__` overrides (memo is not respected)
- [x] Partial support for `__deepcopy__` and `__copy__` overrides (memo is not respected)
- [ ] Support for recursive structures
- [ ] Find some quirky corner cases (there should be some)
- [ ] Make initial construction faster (could be 30-50 times faster than now)
- [ ] Support for memo in `__deepcopy__` and `__copy__` overrides

Project will be ready for release when `duper.deepdups(x)()` will behave the same as `copy.deepcopy()` and be as fast or faster than the latter. 

Currently `duper.deepdups(x)` part is on average 2-5 times slower than `copy.deepcopy()`, so it makes sense to use it only when you need to have a lot of copies of the same object.

If you have any feedback or ideas, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/Bobronium/duper/issues), or  reach out via [bobronium@gmail.com](mailto:bobronium@gmail.com) or [Telegram](https://t.me/Bobronium).

### Why?
It is challenging and fun, of course.

But if I'm being serious, deepcopy is [extremely slow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24756712/deepcopy-is-extremely-slow) and there's [no alternative](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1410615/copy-deepcopy-vs-pickle) that is both faster **and** can replace deepcopy in all cases.



### Keypoints
- Generates a cook-book to reconstruct given object
- Upon subsequent calls, follows optimized instructions to produce new object
- Much faster handling of immutable types and flat collections.


### How fast?
Generally 20-50 times faster than copy.deepcopy() on nested objects.
```py
import duper
import copy
from timesup import timesup


@timesup(number=100000, repeats=3)
def reconstruction():
    
    copy.deepcopy(x)         # ~0.00576 ms (deepcopy)
    dup = duper.deepdups(x)  # ~0.03131 ms (duper_build)
    dup()                    # ~0.00013 ms (duper_dup): 45.18 times faster than deepcopy
```

### Real use case
#### Pydantic
<details>
<summary>Models definition</summary>

```py
from datetime import datetime
from functools import wraps

import duper
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from pydantic.fields import FieldInfo


class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str = "John Doe"
    signup_ts: datetime | None = None
    friends: list[int] = []
    skills: dict[str, int] = {
        "foo": {"count": 4, "size": None},
        "bars": [
            {"apple": "x1", "banana": "y"},
            {"apple": "x2", "banana": "y"},
        ],
    }



@wraps(Field)
def FastField(default, *args, **kwargs):
    """
    Overrides the fields that need to be copied to have default_factories
    """    
    default_factory = duper.deepdups(default)
    field_info: FieldInfo = Field(*args, default_factory=default_factory, **kwargs)
    return field_info


class FastUser(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str = FastField("John Doe")
    signup_ts: datetime | None = FastField(None)
    friends: list[int] = FastField([])
    skills: dict[str, int] = FastField(
        {
            "foo": {"count": 4, "size": None},
            "bars": [
                {"apple": "x1", "banana": "y"},
                {"apple": "x2", "banana": "y"},
            ],
        }
    )
```

</details>

```py
@timesup(number=100000, repeats=3)
def pydantic_defaults():
    User(id=42)        # ~0.00935 ms (with_deepcopy)
    FastUser(id=1337)  # ~0.00292 ms (with_duper): 3.20 times faster than with_deepcopy

```

### ðŸš§ Status
Though the library is in an early development stage, it already outperforms all other solutions I've found when copying objects. 

I am completing the implementation and exploring new and validating existing ideas to improve performance. 

My current priority is to speed up the initial build of the copying factory. It is currently slightly slower than deepcopy in most cases.
