This utility extracts [BibTex] references (a.k.a *markers*) from a [(La)Tex]
file and copies entries from a source, which the *master BibTex file*.  The use
case is exporting all [BetterBibtex] entries to a file on your file system,
usually one that is updated as you add, remove and modify papers in [Zotero].

**Note**:  While the use case was intended for use with Zoter and BetterBibtex,
it will work on any BibTex file.

The program does the following:
1. Parses some large master source BibTex file.
1. Parses a file or recursively all `.tex`, `.sty`, and `.cls` files
   recursively in a directory.
1. Copies the matching entries from the master source BibTex to standard out.

The program makes the assumption that the BibTex entry IDs are unique as the
matches are very loose when parsing the (La)Tex file.


## Obtaining

The easiest way to install the command line program is via the `pip` installer:
```bash
pip3 install zensols.bibstract
```

Binaries are also available on [pypi].


## Usage

This is a command line program written that has the following usage (also use
`--help`):

* Print IDs in a master source file BibTex file: `bibstract showbib`.
* Print cite references in a (La)Tex file: `bibstract showtex <file|directory>`
* Print IDs that will be exported from the BibTex file: `bibstract showexport <file|directory>`
* Export the matching entries to standard out: `bibstract export <file|directory>`


## Converters

A set of *converters* can be specified in the [configuration file], which
modify each parsed BibTex entry in succession.  Currently there the following:
* **date_year**: Converts the year part of a date field to a year.  This is
  useful when using Zotero's Better Biblatex extension that produces BibLatex
  formats, but you need BibTex entries.
* **copy**: Copy or move one or more fields in the entry.  This is useful when
  your bibliography style expects one key, but the output (i.e.BibLatex)
  outputs a different named field). When `destructive` is set to ``True``, this
  copy operation becomes a move.

Converters can be set be set and configured in the [configuration file].


## Configuration

A [configuration file] must be given, whose location is either given with a
`-c` command line argument, or set in the environment variable `BIBSTRACTRC`.

An example [configuration file] is available, which has only one INI section
`default` with option `master_bib` with the master BibTex file.


### Example Configuration File

The following example configuration file points to the a home directory file
where you tell where [BetterBibtex] to export.  It then specifies to convert
dates with years (deleting the `date` field after)when creating the output.

In addition, it copies the `journaltitle` (exported by [BetterBibtex]) to
`journal`, which is used by BibTex.  This converter, called *replace* is
configured the `replace_converter` entry.

```ini
[default]
master_bib = ${env:home}/.zotero-betterbib.bib
converters = date_year_destructive, replace

[replace_converter]
class_name = zensols.bibstract.CopyOrMoveConverter
fields = dict: {'journaltitle': 'journal'}
destructive = False
```
