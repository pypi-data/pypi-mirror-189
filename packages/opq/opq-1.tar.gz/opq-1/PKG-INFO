        **NAME**
        
        |
        | ``opq`` - object programming
        |
        
        **SYNOPSIS**
        
        
        The ``opq`` package provides an Object class, that allows for save/load to/from
        json files on disk. Objects can be searched with database functions and uses
        read-only files to improve persistence and a type in filename for
        reconstruction. Methods are factored out into functions to have a clean
        namespace to read JSON data into.
        
        ``opq`` stores it's data on disk where objects are time versioned and the
        last version saved on disk is served to the user layer. Files are JSON dumps
        that are read-only so thus should provide (disk) persistence. Paths carry the
        type in the path name what makes reconstruction from filename easier then
        reading type from the object.

        **INSTALL**
        
        |
        | ``python3 -m pip install objectprogramming``
        |
        
        **PROGRAMMING**
        
        basic usage is this::
        
         >>> import opq
         >>> o = opq.Object()
         >>> o.key = "value"
         >>> o.key
         >>> 'value'
        
        Objects try to mimic a dictionary while trying to be an object with normal
        attribute access as well. hidden methods are provided, the methods are
        factored out into functions like get, items, keys, register, set, update
        and values.
        
        load/save from/to disk::
        
         >>> from opq import Object, load, save
         >>> o = Object()
         >>> o.key = "value"
         >>> p = save(o)
         >>> obj = Object()
         >>> load(obj, p)
         >>> obj.key
         >>> 'value'
        
        great for giving objects peristence by having their state stored in files::
        
         >>> from opq import Object, save
         >>> o = Object()
         >>> save(o)
         'opq.objects.Object/2021-08-31/15:31:05.717063'
