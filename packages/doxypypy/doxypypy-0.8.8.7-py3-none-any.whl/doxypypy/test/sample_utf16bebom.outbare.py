# UTF-16-BE Python File with a BOM

##
#A UTF-16BE File identified by BOM.
#
#This doesn't have much to it, but it identifies itself
#using a BOM rather than a coding line.
#
#Note:
#	See how doxypypy converts this note and the
#	following warning.
#
#Warning:
#	Be sure to save this file in the proper encoding.
