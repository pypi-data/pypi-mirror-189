Introduction to the GGCE
========================

The GGCE API consists of three major components:

- :class:`ggce.model.Model`: contains all aspects of the Model Hamiltonian to be solved. It also contains information about the level of theory used
- :class:`ggce.engine.system.System`: a lightweight wrapper for the ``Model`` which initializes the system of equations to be solved
- :class:`ggce.executors.solvers.Solver` (and classes which inherit from this base class): solves the system of equations in various ways, using either SciPy or PETSc

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate a simple application of the GGCE method.

Step 1: initialize the model
----------------------------

We begin by initializing a model. Specifically, the model corresponds to an electron-phonon Hamiltonian with Edwards Fermion Boson coupling,

.. math::

    H = -t \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle} c_i^\dagger c_i + \Omega \sum_i b_i^\dagger b_i - g \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle} c_i^\dagger c_j \left( b_j^\dagger + b_i \right)

where in the above, :math:`t` is the electron hopping strength, :math:`\Omega` is the phonon frequency and :math:`g` is the coupling strength. The corresponding model can be initialized in the GGCE API as follows

.. code-block:: python

    from ggce import Model
    model = Model.from_parameters(hopping=0.1)
    model.add_(
        "EdwardsFermionBoson",
        phonon_frequency=1.25,
        phonon_extent=3,
        phonon_number=9,
        dimensionless_coupling_strength=2.5
    )

where ``dimensionless_coupling_strength`` is related to :math:`g`. Above, ``1.25`` is the value for :math:`\Omega`, and ``3`` and ``9`` are the values of the maximum cloud extent and maximum number of allowed phonons.

.. hint::

    While we highly recommend reviewing the literature as presented in `Carbone, Reichman & Sous, PRB 104, 035106 (2021) <https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.104.035106>`__ for more background on these parameters, the maximum phonon extent and total number of phonons can if nothing else be thought of as convergence parameters. In the limit as these two values approaches infinity, the calculation becomes numerically exact.

Step 2: initialize the system
-----------------------------

The next step is extremely simple. Initializing the ``System`` object will trigger a build of all of the necessary Python objects representing a system of equations to solve:

.. code-block:: python

    from ggce import System
    system = System(model)


.. note::

    The GGCE code implements a comprehensive logger through Loguru. Debugging mode can be controlled using the :class:`ggce.logger.debug` context manager.

While working in some sort of interactive environment such as iPython or Jupyter, you can use

.. code-block:: python

    model.visualize()

to visualize the current state of the model. For example, in the current system, calling ``model.visualize()`` produces the following output

.. code-block::

    Hamiltonian parameters:
      Hopping (t)          = 0.10
      Lattice constant (a) = 1.00
      Temperature (T)      = 0.00
      Max bosons per site  = None
      Absolute extent      = 3
    Terms:
      Phonon type = 0 (M = 3; N = 9)
        EdwardsFermionBoson: 2.50 x ([1] [1] +) | 0 (1.25)
        EdwardsFermionBoson: 2.50 x ([-1] [-1] +) | 0 (1.25)
        EdwardsFermionBoson: 2.50 x ([1] [0] -) | 0 (1.25)
        EdwardsFermionBoson: 2.50 x ([-1] [0] -) | 0 (1.25)

The output contains Hamiltonian parameters and terms. The hopping, lattice constant and temperature should be self-explanatory. The max bosons per site is used to limit the number of total phonons per site in any auxiliary Green's function, and the absolute extent is only relevant in multi-phonon-mode models (more on finite-temperature and multi-phonon-mode models later). The terms index the type of couplings beign used in the model. First listed is the type of coulpling, then the value of the prefactor :math:`g`, and then some more complicated information about the phonon interactions. These extra data are usually just used for debugging, but can be interpreted.

Step 3: solve the system
------------------------

GGCE offers multiple ways to solve an initialized ``System`` object. In this tutorial, we will use the most efficient method for relatively small matrices (or sets of equations): a direct, dense solver. Specifically, we will leverage SciPy's solver engines to do this, and these engines are based on e.g. BLAS, and as such are extremely fast and multi-threaded, being able to take advantage of multi-core machines.

First, initialize the ``Solver`` itself.

.. code-block:: python

    from ggce import DenseSolver
    solver = DenseSolver(system)


Next, we solve the system.

.. code-block:: python

    k = np.array([0.0, np.pi / 2.0, np.pi])
    w = np.linspace(-6.0, -2.0, 100)
    solver = DenseSolver(system)
    G = solver.greens_function(k, w, eta=0.005, pbar=True)

Calling the ``greens_function`` method returns the full Green's function at the level of theory specified in the ``Model``. One can easily obtain the spectral function by just taking :math:`-\mathrm{Im} \: G(k, \omega) / \pi`:

.. code-block:: python

    A = -G.imag / np.pi
