qcodes_loop
===========


``qcodes_loop`` contains modules that used to be part of QCoDeS but were deprecated and removed in the spring of 2023.
The last QCoDeS release supporting usage of the ``Loop`` and associated modules was `v0.37.0 <https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/releases/tag/v0.37.0>`_.

The modules in question are: ``qcodes_loop.data``, ``qcodes_loop.data`` and ``qcodes_loop.plot``
