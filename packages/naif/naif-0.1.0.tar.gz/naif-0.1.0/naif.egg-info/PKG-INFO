Description: $\texttt{naif}$ is a pure-python package for numerical analysis of
        frequencies for orbits. It is based on the NAFF algorithm originally
        proposed by Laskar (1990, 1993), and further developed by Valluri &
        Merritt (1998). It is specially based on, and improves on, the Fortran
        code developed by Valluri & Merritt (1998). Besides extracting the
        frequencies with largest amplitudes in the spectrum, the package also
        has tools to print the spectra before extraction of each frequency and
        to "debug" the frequency identification around a specific peak.
