## Added

- New arguments `option_set_size` and `option_set_size_prob` to allow generating options with set of possible values.

- The sentences can have a word between commas with a given probability.

- The arguments can have any number of values (via `any_number` argument) and have nested options (via `nested`), see `utils.make_argument` function.

- The description can have the same element as an example.
