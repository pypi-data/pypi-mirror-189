``selkie.com`` â€” Command invocation
===================================

System calls
------------

.. py:function:: system(*args[, silent=False])

   Execute a system command line.  Unless silent=True is specified,
   the output is printed to stdout.  The return value is True if the
   command executes successfully and False if not.  Example::

      system('ls', '-l')

.. py:function:: backtick(*args):

   Execute a system command line.  Nothing is printed.  The return
   value is a structure with three members: returncode, stdout, and
   stderr.  The values of stdout and stderr are strings.

Main
----

Main provides command-line processing for a Python script.  To use it,
subclass it and define methods whose name begins with ``com_``.  For
example::

   class MyMain (Main):

       def com_foo (self, x, y, t=None):
           ...

To use it::

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       main = MyMain()
       main()
   
When calling the script::

   python -m mymodule foo -t=42 hi bye

This invocation calls ``main.com_foo('hi', 'bye', t='42')``.

A help command (invoked by ``-?`` or ``--help``) is automatically
generated from the method signatures, the documentation string of the
class, and the documentation strings of the methods.

.. py:class:: selkie.com.Main

   Provides generic Main class for an executable.  A Main class
   represents a collection of commands.  Any method whose name begins
   with ``com_`` defines a command.

   .. py:method:: __call__(comline)

      If *comline* is omitted, sys.argv is used.  The command line
      should have the form: *command* *flags* *args*.  A method must
      exist whose name is *command* prefixed with ``com_``.  Its
      positional arguments determine the number and interpretation of
      the *args*, and its keyword arguments determine the valid
      *flags*.  A flag must have the form ``-fKW=VAL``, where *KW* is
      a keyword argument and *VAL* is the value that it receives.
      ``=VAL`` may be omitted, in which case the value is True.

      *Comline* may also have the form ``-?`` or ``--help``, in which
      case a usage message is printed.  The usage message is assembled
      from:

       * the class documentation string (of the class specializing Main).
       * the parameter names of the command methods (those whose names
	 begin with ``com_``).
       * the documentation strings of the command methods.

.. py:class:: selkie.com.Shift

   A command-line processor that Main uses internally.  Use it in a
   with-statement::
   
      with Shift() as shift:
          ...
   
   .. py:method:: __call__(tgt)

      Returns the next argument and advances its internal pointer.
      *Tgt* is optional.  If provided, Shift advances the
      pointer and returns ``True`` if the next argument equals *tgt*,
      and does nothing and returns ``False`` otherwise.

   .. py:method:: able()

      Returns True just in case ``__call__()`` will succeed.  (Note that
      ``__call__(tgt)`` always succeeds.)

   .. py:method:: error(msg)

      Prints an error message and usage to stderr, then exits.

   .. py:method:: peek(tgt)

      Return the next argument without consuming it.  *Tgt* is
      optional and interpreted as for ``__call__()``.

   .. py:method:: isflag()

      Returns ``True`` if the next argument begins with
      ``-``.

   .. py:method:: flag()

      Returns the next argument, if it is a flag.  Returns
      ``None`` otherwise.

   .. py:method:: ifable()

      Returns the next argument, if it exists.  Returns
      ``None`` otherwise.

   .. py:method:: rest()

      Returns all remaining arguments.

   .. py:method:: isdone()

      Returns true if no arguments remain.

   .. py:method:: set_usage(msg)

      Sets the usage message.

   .. py:method:: print_usage()

      Prints out the usage message.

Timeout
-------

.. py:class:: selkie.com.Timeout

A ``with Timeout()`` block can be used to limit the amount of
time that some code can run::

   with Timeout(2.0):
       value = do_something()

A timer will run for 2.0 seconds, at which point the body code will be
interrupted (using a KeyboardInterrupt, equivalent to ctrl-C).  If the
body code completes before the timer goes off, the timer will be
cancelled.

One can use the effects of the body to determine whether it completed
successfully (in the example, by looking at ``value``).
Alternatively, Timeout takes a second argument, ``ontimeout``, which is a function
that will be called if the body is interrupted by the timer.

Timing
------

One can create a timer::

   >>> timer = Timer()

Every time one calls ``str()`` on it, one obtains a printed version
of the elapsed time since it was created::

   >>> print timer
   0:00:03.316634

The function that ``Timer`` uses for printing is separately
available as ``selkie.string.elapsed_time_str()``.

Progress indicator
------------------

To create a progress indicator::

   >>> progress = Progress(10)

The value *n* is the total number of "work units" that will be necessary.
To cause a progress message to be printed, increment the indicator::

   >>> progress += 1
   Progress: 10.00% Time remaining: 24.097824


XTerm escapes
-------------

The functions ``red()`` and ``green()`` set the foreground color for
their argument::

   >>> print(red('hi'), green('bye'))


The function ``repln()`` causes its argument to replace the contents
of the current line.  It does a carriage return and line kill::

   >>> print('hi there')
   >>> print(repln('bye'))

Alternatively::

   >>> print(repln(), 'bye')
