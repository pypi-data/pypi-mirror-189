    """Compute the Earth Mover's Distance.

    This function uses the auction algorithm for approximation, hence the assignment is not
    guranteed to be a bijection. The current implementation works only on CUDA.

    Args:
        prediction: The predicted point cloud with shape ([B,] NUM_POINTS, 3). NUM_POINTS should be
        a multiple of 1024.
        groundtruth: The groundtruth point cloud with shape ([B,] NUM_POINTS, 3). NUM_POINTS should
        be a multiple of 1024.
        eps: the balance between the error rate and the speed of convergence.
        iterations: The max number of iterations.
        squared: If true return the squared euclidean distance.
        reduction: Specifies the reduction to apply to the output: 'none' | 'mean' | 'sum'.

    Raises:
        ModuleNotFoundError: If the cuda extension is not installed.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing:
        - A tensor with the average/sum computed distance according to Earth Mover's assignment.
        - A tensor with the assigned index for each point.
