"""
This module provides the core classes for loading, preprocessing, and constructing time annotations for imaging data.

'ImageLoader' is the core class that loads the image data and selects the appropriate loader based on the file type. It
also collects information about the data type and number of frames per file.

'FileManager', 'FrameManager', and 'VolumeManager' are core classes that preprocess information about the experiment
data. The 'FileManager' class contains information about the location and file type of the image files,
while the 'FrameManager' class contains information about the number of frames in the experiment and the mapping of
frames to files. The 'VolumeManager' class contains information about the image volumes in the experiment,
including the number of frames per volume and the mapping of frames to volumes.

'TimeLabel', 'Labels', 'Cycle', 'Timeline', and 'Annotation' classes help to construct and store time annotations. The
'TimeLabel' class stores information about specific time-located events during the experiment, such as a specific
condition described by a group and label. The 'Labels' class stores information about a group of time labels,
such as temperature, light, sound, image on the screen, drug, or behavior. The 'Cycle' class stores and preprocesses
information about repeated cycles of labels, useful for creating annotations for periodic conditions. The 'Timeline'
class stores and preprocesses information about the sequence of labels, useful for creating annotations for
non-periodic conditions. Finally, the 'Annotation' class stores and preprocesses information about the time annotation
of the experiment; it uses either the 'Cycle' or 'Timeline' classes to initialize the annotation.
