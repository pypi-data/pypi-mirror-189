# SC ENGINE

SC-Engine is a rotation engine coded by @SplatCraft

It works with Oz-Engine (or other libraries)

## SETUP

In shell, type the following command :

`pip install SC-Engine`

In your file, write this:

```python
import SC
```
## USE

Let's try to rotate a point around another point !

```python
new = SC.rotate([1,1] , 90 , [3,3])

# here we are rotating the point at x=1 y=1 around the point at x=3 y=3 to 90 degrees

# this function returns a list of two integers [x,y]

print(new)
```
Run the project and see what happens
```python
[5, 5]
```
And those are the new coordinates of the point !
