The presence of a contact between two residues in a macromolecular system (proteins nucleic acids etc.) is established when the minimum interresidue heavy atom pair distance falls within a specified cutoff (4-5 Å) for a given majority (for example, 75% or above snapshots) of the simulation time.

This program heavily depends on MDTraj simulation analysis program (1)
