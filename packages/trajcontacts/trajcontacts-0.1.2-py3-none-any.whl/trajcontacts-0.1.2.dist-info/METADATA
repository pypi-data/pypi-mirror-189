Requires-Dist: mdtraj
Requires-Dist: numpy

The presence of a contact between two residues in macromolecular systems, such as proteins and nucleic acids, is established when the minimum interresidue heavy atom pair distance falls within a specified cutoff (4-5 Å) for a given majority (for example, 75% or above snapshots) of the simulation time.

This program depends on MDTraj simulation analysis package (1): mdtraj.load() is used for trajectory/topology inputs and inter-atomic distances are calculated using mdtraj.distance()
