Page Defragment Node

This is a SQL Query Execution Plan Node.

    Orignally implemented to test if datasets have any records as they pass through
    the DAG, this function normalizes the number of bytes per page.

    This is to balance two competing demands:
        - operate in a low memory environment, if the pages are too large they may
          cause the process to fail.
        - operate quickly, if we spend our time doing SIMD on pages with few records
          we're not working as fast as we can.

    The low-water mark is 75% of the target size, less than this we look to merge
    pages together. This is more common following the implementation of projection
    push down, one column doesn't take up a lot of memory so we consolidate tens of
    pages into a single page.

    The high-water mark is 199% of the target size, more than this we split the page.
    Splitting at a size any less than this will end up with pages less that the target
    page size.
