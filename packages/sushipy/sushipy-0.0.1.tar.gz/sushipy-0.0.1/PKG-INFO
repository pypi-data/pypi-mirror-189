<h3 align='center'> sushi is a library that allows you to run functions from other languages without actually translating them</h3>

<h2> how it works? </h2>
<p>Instead of translating code from one language to another, sushi compiles or interprets code creating an executable file or a runnable version of the code so it can be executed and outputed to terminal making it as fast like it would normally be.</p>
