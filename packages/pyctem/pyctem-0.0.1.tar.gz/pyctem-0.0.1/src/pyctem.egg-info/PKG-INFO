PyCTEM - A Python based toolset for computational S/TEM
=======================================================

*PyCTEM* - short for **Py**thon-based toolset for **c**omputational (scanning-) 
transmission electron microscopy (**TEM**).
Under the term computational S/TEM we understand the computer-based part of transmission
electron microscopy, meaning scattering simulations, data evaluations as well
as data visualization. 

The core of *PyCTEM* is a Python library, which provides functions 
and classes allowing a fine-grained control over the individual steps of
these use cases. On top of this library it features several high level Python entry points as well as
command line tools. 

The *PyCTEM* package is currently under development. It will eventually feature the
full functionality of the internal Python toolset developed over the
last decade for computational TEM at the Technische Universit√§t Berlin.
