Activities of Daily living (ADLs) e.g cooking, working, sleeping and device readings are recorded by Smart 
Home inhabitants. 

The objective is to predict inhabitants activities using the device readings.
Pyadlml offers an easy way to fetch, visualize and preprocess common datasets. Furthermore 
a pipeline and TODO

## !! Disclaimer !!
Package is still an alpha-version and in active development. 
Consequently, things are going to change and break and may not work at all. 
Nevertheless, feel free to take a look the package and use what is already finished.

## Last Stable Release
```sh 
$ pip install pyadlml
```
## Latest Development Changes
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/tcsvn/pyadlml
$ cd pyadlml
$ pip install .
```

## Usage example

```python
from pyadlml.dataset import fetch_amsterdam

# Fetch dataset
data = fetch_amsterdam()
df_activites = data['activities']
df_devices = data['devices']

# Plot an inhabitants activity density distribution over one day
from pyadlml.plot import plot_act_density

plot_act_density(df_activities).show()

# Create a vector of smart home device states and discretize the event data in 20 second bins
from pyadlml.preprocessing import StateVectorEncoder, LabelEncoder

sve = StateVectorEncoder(encoding='raw', dt='20s')
raw = sve.fit_transform(df_devices)

# Label the datapoints with the corresponding activity
lbls = LabelEncoder().fit_transform(df_activities, raw)

X = raw.values
y = lbls.values

# Proceed with machine learning techniques you already know
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf.fit(X, y)
...
```

## Educational examples, benchmarks and replications
The project includes a leaderboard of current models to the best of knowledge. 
In addition, a lot of models are compared on a cleaned version of all the available datasets. 
Furthermore, there is a useful list of references that is still 
growing on papers to read. 
For all this check out the [notebooks]().
