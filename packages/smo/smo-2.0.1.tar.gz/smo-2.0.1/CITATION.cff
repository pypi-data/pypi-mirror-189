  Quantitative analysis of high-throughput microscopy
  images requires robust automated algorithms.
  Background estimation is usually the first step and
  has an impact on all subsequent analysis, in
  particular for foreground detection and calculation
  of ratiometric quantities. Most methods recover
  only a single background value, such as the median.
  Those that aim to retrieve a background
  distribution by dividing the intensity histogram
  yield a biased estimation in images in non-trivial
  cases. In this work, we present the first method to
  recover an unbiased estimation of the background
  distribution directly from an image and without any
  additional input. Through a robust statistical
  test, our method leverages the lack of local
  spatial correlation in background pixels to select
  a subset of pixels that accurately represent the
  background distribution. This method is both fast
  and simple to implement, as it only uses standard
  mathematical operations and an averaging filter.
  Additionally, the only parameter, the size of the
  averaging filter, does not require fine tuning. The
  obtained background distribution can be used to
  test for foreground membership of individual
  pixels, or to estimate confidence intervals in
  derived quantities. We expect that the concepts
  described in this work can help to develop a novel
  family of robust segmentation methods.
