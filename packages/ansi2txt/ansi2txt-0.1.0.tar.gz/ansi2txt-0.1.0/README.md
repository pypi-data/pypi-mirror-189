## Acknowledgements

This code base is a translation/port of the `ansi2txt.c` code base from [colorized-logs](https://github.com/kilobyte/colorized-logs) to Python3.
This project came about because I liked the original `ansi2txt`'s output but did not want to have to compile it or ship binaries around.
