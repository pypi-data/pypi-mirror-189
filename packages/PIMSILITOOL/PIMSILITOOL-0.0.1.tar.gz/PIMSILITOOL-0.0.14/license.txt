signed by both parties.

19. MISCELLANEOUS. Unless otherwise expressly stated in these terms and conditions, the failure of either Party to
enforce at any time any term or condition herein will not be a waiver of the provision, or any other provision, or of the right
of the Party to enforce any provision in these terms and conditions. All remedies available to G2-IS for breach of these
terms and conditions are cumulative and may be exercised concurrently or separately, and the exercise of any one remedy
will not be deemed an election of that remedy to the exclusion of any other remedies.
