    Adds nodes and edges to the undirected graph's adjacency list, as well as

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph_adjacency_list
        A defaultdict(set) representing the adjacency list of the undirected graph.
    edge_weights
        A defaultdict(dict) representing the edge weight matrix.

        Function that receives two tuples of node coordinates and obtains a
        weight for the edge formed by the nodes. By default, we use the
        Haversine distance function, as we assume that the coordinates of the
