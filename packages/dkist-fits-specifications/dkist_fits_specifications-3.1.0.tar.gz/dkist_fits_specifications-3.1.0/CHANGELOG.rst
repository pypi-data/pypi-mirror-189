- Set required DL-NIRSP keywords. (`#27 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-fits-specifications/pull-requests/27>`__)


New Feature in the Python API
-----------------------------

- Refactor how FITS keywords are integer-expanded. (`#25 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-fits-specifications/pull-requests/25>`__)


v3.0.0 (2022-10-26)

v2.0.0 (2022-04-26)
===================

Backwards Compatible Changes to the Specification
-------------------------------------------------

- Updated Spec122 and Spec214 schemas to be consistent with SPEC-122 Rev F. (`#21 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-fits-specifications/pull-requests/21>`__)


New Feature in the Python API
-----------------------------

- Change the return values of all specification loading functions to be
  ``frozendict``.
  This means that the specifications once constructed are (largely) immutable and
  therefore can be cached. Caching the specfications massively speeds up
  subsequent calls to the specification construction functions. (`#22 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-fits-specifications/pull-requests/22>`__)


v1.5.0 (2022-02-10)
===================

Documentation
-------------

- Add a documenation build for the yaml files containing the specifications and other information about the data products. (`#18 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-fits-specifications/pull-requests/18>`__)
