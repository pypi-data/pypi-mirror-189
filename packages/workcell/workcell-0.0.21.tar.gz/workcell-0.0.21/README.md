## Status

| Status | Stability | Goal |
| ------ | ------ | ---- |
| ✅ | Alpha | We are testing Workcell with a closed set of customers |
| 🚧 | Public Alpha | Anyone can sign up over at weanalyze.co. But go easy on us, there are a few kinks. |
| ❌ | Public Beta | Stable enough for most non-enterprise use-cases |
| ❌ | Public | Production-ready |

We are currently in Alpha. 

## Requirements

Python 3.8+

## Installation

Recomended: First activate your virtual environment, with your favourite system. For example, we like poetry and conda!

```bash
pip install workcell
```

## Getting Started

1. A simple workcell-compatible function could look like this:

    ```python
    from pydantic import BaseModel

    class Input(BaseModel):
        message: str

    class Output(BaseModel):
        message: str

    def hello_workcell(input: Input) -> Output:
        """Returns the `message` of the input data."""
        return Output(message=input.message)
    ```

    _💡 A workcell-compatible function is required to have an `input` parameter and return value based on [Pydantic models](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/). The input and output models are specified via [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)._

2. Copy this code to a file named `app.py`, put into a folder, e.g. `hello_workcell`

3. Run the HTTP API server from command-line:

    ```bash
    cd hello_workcell
    workcell serve app:hello_workcell
    ```
    _In the output, there's a line that shows where your API is being served, on your local machine._

4. Run the Streamlit based UI server from command-line:

    ```bash
    workcell serve-ui app:hello_workcell
    ```
    _In the output, there's a line that shows where your UI is being served, on your local machine._

5. **Deploy workcell into weanalyze cloud:**

   🚧 Working in progress, will be updated soon...
