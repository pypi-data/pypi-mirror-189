## Installation
```shell
git clone https://github.com/jo1gi/audiobook-dl.git
cd audiobook-dl
python3 setup.py install
```

Some features require [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) which can be installed
through most package managers or from [ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

## Cookies
audiobook-dl uses Netscape cookie files for authentication in most cases. I use
[this](https://github.com/rotemdan/ExportCookies) extension to export my cookies
from the browser.

Cookies can be placed in current dir as `cookies.txt` or be given with the
`--cookie` argument.

## Downloading audiobooks
```shell
audiobook-dl -c <cookie file> <url>
```
**Most sites require you to provide the listening page not not just the
information page**
