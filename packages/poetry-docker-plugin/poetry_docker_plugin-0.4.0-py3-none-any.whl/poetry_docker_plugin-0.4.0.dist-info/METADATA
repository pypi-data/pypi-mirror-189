A [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) plugin for configuring and building docker images directly from python projects.

## Installation

In order to install the plugin you need to have installed a poetry version `>1.0` and type:

```bash
poetry self add poetry-docker-plugin
```

## Simple Example

Let's assume that you have created a Poetry project having the following `pyproject.toml` configuration:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "example_project"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "An example poetry project."
authors = ["Evangelos"]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "3.11"

[tool.poetry.scripts]
run_service = "app.service:start"
```

your project also declares a poetry script that starts a service. Then, by adding the following minimal docker configuration in your `pyproject.toml` you can build your docker image:

```toml
[tool.docker]
copy = [
    { source = "example_project-1.0.0.tar.gz", target = "/app/example_project.tar.gz" },
]
flow = [
    { run = "pip install /app/example_project.tar.gz" },
]
expose = [8000]
cmd = ["run_service"]
```

Note that there is no docker [FROM](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from)  command, and thus `poetry-docker-plugin` automatically figures out the python version and use `python:3.11` as the base image. Moreover, since we have not defined a name for the image, it derives one, using the first author name and the project name. Thus, by running the command `poetry docker`, poetry builds a docker image ready to run your service in port 8000.
 
## Docker Configuration Skeleton

The configuration below outlines all supported commands:

```toml
[tool.docker]
image_name = "org/image_name:version"
args = { version = "1.2.0" } # default values for args
from = "python:3.11"
labels = { "description" = "Poetry docker plugin is awesome." }
copy = [
    { source = "./poetry-docker-plugin-0.1.0.tar.gz", target = "/opt/pdp.tar.gz" },
]
env.SERVICE_CONFIGURATION = "/opt/service.conf"
volume = ["/data"]
flow = [
    # a sequence of WORKDIR and RUN commands
    { work_dir = "/opt" },
    { run = "ls" },
    { work_dir = "/tmp" },
    { run = "ls /opt" },
]
expose = [8888, 9999]
# alternatively you may use entrypoint = []
cmd = ["run_service", "--verbose"]
```

then, as soon as you are done configuring, type:

```bash
poetry docker
```
