# akkpredict evx ML model

This is a simplified version of [evxpredictor](https://pypi.org/project/evxpredictor/) package used to generate buy and sell signals for crypto and conventional stock markets based on the excess volume indicator(EVX). EVX is a concept where the bid-ask spread is estimated inherently from current market prices. 

You can read more about Evx in the free whitepaper [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345313655_DeFiPaper)  
# Installation
Install akkpredict with `python3 -m pip install akkpredict`  
# Usage

In your python script simply import the module and use as follows:

```  
from akkpredict.moonapi import Moon, signal
print(signal(20,65,utcdatetime))
```
The above methods take an assets open, close prices of the asset based on the time interval you have chosen in OHCLV type. A zero classification output would instruct the user to sell, while one output means don't sell or buy if the asset is not already present in the orders.  

# Warning
This is not financial advise. akkpredict is entirely on its preliminary stages. Use it at your own risk.
