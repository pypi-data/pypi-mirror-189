### About "shapes_recognition"
Recognition is an intrinsic property of the human intellect. Kids aged 2-2.5 years old can recognize shapes even if they differ in size, position, direction, or are severely deformed.

To simulate such recognition capability, we introduce the **shapes_recognition** library.

we show how to use it.
