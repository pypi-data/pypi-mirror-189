Reahl is a web application framework that allows a Python programmer to work in terms of useful abstractions - using a single programming language.

The reahl-component-metadata package extends setuptools's setup() call to take an extra "component" keyword argument for packaging the extra metadata reahl-component requires.

This package is very small and meant to be a build dependency of packages that are Reahl components.
