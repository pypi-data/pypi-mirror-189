The goal is to provide a quick\nsummary that is easily interpretable by combining results from a pre-trained Python natural language processing package with the use of visualizations.\n\n## Installation\n\nEnsure that your python version is <=3.9.\nTo install the package, run the following.\n```bash\npip install pysentimentanalyzer\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThis package provides the following 4 functions:\n\n* `generate_wordcloud` - Create a wordcloud of the most common positive and negative words.\n* `aggregate_sentiment_score` - Calculates the overall sentiment score of the input texts.\n* `convert_to_likert` - Converts the sentiment score to a likert scale ranging from 1-5.\n* `sentiment_score_plot` - Creates a binned histogram showing count of reviews against the sentiment score.\n\nAll functions take a Pandas DataFrame and string of the column name containing the texts as arguments.\n\nSee below for an example of how to use the package.\n\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pysentimentanalyzer.generate_wordcloud import *\nfrom pysentimentanalyzer.get_aggregated_sentiment_score import *\nfrom pysentimentanalyzer.likert_scale import *\nfrom pysentimentanalyzer.sentiment_score_plot import *\n\ndf = pd.read_csv("test_tweets.csv") # assuming the csv exists in the current directory\ndf = df.head(200)       \n```\n\n```\naggregate_sentiment_score(df, "text")\n>>> -0.143\n```\n\n```\nconvert_to_likert(df, "text")\n>>> (\'neutral\', 3)\n```\n\n```\nsentiment_score_plot(df, "text")\n```\n![histogram](img/histogram_output.png)\n\n```\nwordcloud_list = generate_wordcloud(df, "text")\nwordcloud_list[0]\n```\n![wordcloud](img/wordcloud_output.png)\n\n## Similar Packages\n\nWhile there exists many packages and libraries for sentiment analysis and many projects built on top of those packages, we could not find specific packages that combines the use of sentiment analysis with visualizations. However, we expect there to be many projects done by individuals that likely perform similar functions by making use of existing NLP packages. Our package aims enhance the existing NLP packages by providing a quick and simple way to generate summary visualizations.\nSome Python packages that perform sentiment analysis include:\n\n* [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)\n* [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment)\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis package was created by Group 8 of the DSCI 524 course with members Eric Tsai, Ranjit Sundaramurthi, Tanmay Agarwal and Ziyi Chen.
