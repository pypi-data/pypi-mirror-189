HiQ - A Modern Observability System
*************************************************

|Documentation Status| |CodeCov| |Github release| |lic|

HiQ is a ``declarative``, ``non-intrusive``, ``dynamic`` and
``transparent`` tracking system for both **monolithic** application and
**distributed** system. It brings the runtime information tracking and
optimization to a new level without compromising with speed and system
performance, or hiding any tracking overhead information. HiQ applies
for both I/O bound and CPU bound applications.

To explain the four features, **declarative** means you can declare the
things you want to track in a text file, which could be a json, yaml or
even csv,and no need to change program code. **Non-intrusive** means HiQ
doesnâ€™t requires to modify original python code. **Dynamic** means HiQ
supports tracing metrics featuring at run time, which can be used for
adaptive tracing. **Transparent** means HiQ provides the tracing
overhead and doesnâ€™t hide it no matter it is huge or tiny.

In addition to latency tracking, HiQ provides memory, disk I/O and
Network I/O tracking out of the box. The output can be saved in form of
normal line by line log file, or HiQ tree, or span graph.

Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

   pip install hiq-python

Get Started
-----------

Let start with a simplest example by running HiQ against a simple
monolithic python code `ðŸ“„
main.py <https://github.com/oracle-samples/hiq/blob/main/hiq/examples/quick_start/main.py>`__:

.. code:: python

   # this is the main.py python source code
   import time

   def func1():
       time.sleep(1.5)
       print("func1")
       func2()

   def func2():
       time.sleep(2.5)
       print("func2")

   def main():
       func1()

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()

In this code, there is a simple chain of function calls: ``main()`` ->
``func1`` -> ``func2``.

Now we want to trace the functions without modifying its code. Letâ€™s run
the following:

.. code:: python

   git clone https://github.com/oracle-samples/hiq.git
   cd hiq/examples/quick_start
   python main_driver.py

If everything is fine, you should be able to see the output like this:

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle-samples/hiq/main/hiq/docs/source/img/main_driver.jpg

   An HiQ Simplest Example

From the screenshot we can see the timestamp and the latency of each
function:

=============== ====== ====== ====== ================
\               main   func1  func2  tracing overhead
=============== ====== ====== ====== ================
latency(second) 4.0045 4.0044 2.5026 0.0000163
=============== ====== ====== ====== ================

HiQ just traced the ``main.py`` file running without touching one line
of its code.
