Reahl is a web application framework that allows a Python programmer to work in terms of useful abstractions - using a single programming language.

Reahl-browsertools provides an interface to Selenium WebDriver that simplifies tests that deal with ajax. It also includes programmatically composable XPaths that are easy to read in code.
