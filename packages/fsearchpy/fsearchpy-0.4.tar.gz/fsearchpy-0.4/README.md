This script is a command-line tool that searches for a specified text pattern in various types of documents, including office documents, PDFs, and archives. It uses the argparse module to handle command-line arguments, allowing the user to specify the directory to search and the text pattern to look for. The script also uses several other modules, including fitz, pandas, numpy, pptx, docx, zipfile, and rarfile. The script also checks if these modules are installed on the user's computer and if not, it will ask the user if they want to install them automatically. The script will then search for the specified text pattern in all subfolders of the given directory and print the results, including file name, path, size, and the line where the text was found. Additionally, it will show the progress of the search and the time it took to complete the search.
